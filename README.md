Choose the content type you're interested in, such as attractions, restaurants, hotels, trips, tours, or vacation rentals. For hotel scraping, you can also set check-in and check-out date ranges.

For detailed guidance on configuring input fields and examples, please refer to the [Input page](https://console.apify.com/actors/r6WbvwpdX4XIb61OM/console?fpr=ve081&fp_sid=github_tripadvisor-scraper).

## Maximum Results

The number of results you can scrape with Tripadvisor Scraper can vary significantly based on factors such as the input complexity, location, and website limitations. While the actor is designed to handle a large volume of data, it's important to note that:

- Tripadvisor's website may display different results based on input type and value.
- Tripadvisor may have internal limits that affect the scraping results.
- The actor itself may have limitations that are continually being improved.

For the most accurate results for your specific use case, it is recommended to perform a test run to determine the maximum number of results achievable.

## Tripadvisor's Hotel Results Limit

Tripadvisor imposes a limit of approximately 3000 hotels per country/region. To overcome this limitation, you should split your searches into deeper city searches and let the scraper scrape all hotels for each city within your specified location, ensuring you receive all available results.

## Input Configuration

When running Tripadvisor Scraper, you can configure what data to scrape and how to extract it. Input can be provided in either a JSON file or through the Apify platform's editor. Most input fields have reasonable default values. For detailed descriptions and examples of input fields, refer to the screenshot below or visit the [Input page](https://console.apify.com/actors/r6WbvwpdX4XIb61OM/console?fpr=ve081&fp_sid=github_tripadvisor-scraper).
